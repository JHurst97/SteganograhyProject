<p>This program takes a cover image and allows the user to store text OR an image inside of another image.</p>
<p>User can choose to modify 1/2/3/4 LSB (least significant bit(s)).<p> 
<p>1LSB means less potential storage but less noise (1/255) - 4LSB means more 4x more potential storage than 1LSB but 4x the noise (16/255)<p>
<p>Image embed is currently always set to 1LSB, the input image must be 8x smaller than the cover image.</p>
<p>I made a YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/Bgl_wmb9dU0">demonstration</a> for this program but it is slightly outdated now, it's still the same concept though!</p>
